# Draw-Circle
This was my final assignment on the JAVA subject. This assignment was able to let the user input the coordinates and radius of two circle.
After the user clicks the "Redraw" button, my program will show up the circles based on the user input. User also can click and drag the circle and the coordinate will be chnaged too.

Here are some images about my program~
